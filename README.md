# My first video-game

	A couple with a dog and a cat spawn on an island. First they will need to survive, and find a location that suits them. After that, they will be able to build and develop their base.

	Each character will have specials abilities, and according to this abilities, they will be able to complete mission or tasks.

	This island is not friendly, and you will need to distribute the stains in relation of you strengths, to find new ressources and improve your skills.

## Human

Both start with the same abilities, and will be able to specialize in several categories.

Each human start with an inventory, and can carry multiple objects. they can build and craft new object. 

## Animals

They have unique abilities, and some of their specialisations will be unique aswell.

### Dog

	The Dog will be the first way to defend yourself, but be careful, he can only attack one ennemy at a time. He also like digging holes, where he find sometimes some wonderful things. 

	When he is at your base, his main goal will be to defend the base. He will inform you when the base is being attack.

During an attack in the base:

	Default:
		- If your dog is alone in the base, he will automatically start to defend the base, and attack the nearest ennemy. 
		- If one of the human is with him, he will alert you, and start defending the base except if you tell him to do something else.

During an attack outside:
	Default:
		Your dog will always prioritize your safety, and target the closest ennemy.
	
	
If you want/need your dog outside your base, he will need to be with a human.

### Cat

	The cat will be way more independant than the dog. At first you will not be able to decide what he will do or where he will go. He is capable of defend himself, but will not protect the group all the time.
